README

This is a repo for scripts I’ve created to simplify and easily update docker containers I’m using personally. This will continue to expand as I find and deploy new containers for home use.
Note: config scripts deploy a single container so take note of any volumes or ports shared while service scripts deploy a service. I've found that these work well in a 3 node cluster and use shared storage on an NFS mount.
